'''# Pallet Logic System - Implementation Guide

## Pallet Basics
- Pallets are special platforms used to stack and transport goods
- Each pallet has specific properties:
    - Length and width (the base dimensions)
    - Thickness (height of the empty pallet)
    - Maximum stack height (how tall items can be stacked on it)
    - Maximum weight capacity (total weight the pallet can support)

## Calculation Requirements
1. Calculate the number of pallets needed based on:
     - Total volume of items to be stored
     - Total weight of items to be stored
     - Available floor space in the container
     - Maximum height constraints

2. For each pallet, track:
     - Current stack height
     - Current total weight
     - List of items placed on it

## Visualization Rules
1. Place calculated number of pallets at the bottom of the container
2. Draw pallets in brown color
3. Stack items on top of pallets, ensuring:
     - Items don't exceed pallet dimensions (length/width)
     - Total stack height doesn't exceed maximum allowed height
     - Total weight doesn't exceed pallet capacity

## Implementation Steps
1. Define pallet and item classes with appropriate properties
2. Create algorithm to calculate optimal number of pallets
3. Develop placement logic for items onto pallets
4. Implement visualization of pallets and stacked items'''
